I try to replicate my learning from codeWithHarry reactJS by making another app that will be capable of finding events near a user residing in United States and Canada by utilizing ReactJS Hooks, Function based components, and ticketMaster API .


-------- sidenote ----------
- Google's SerpAPI is awesome and wanted to try it for this app but sadly it only provides 100 searches per month :(
